    * (Geometry: intersecting point)
    * Two points on line 1 are given as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and on line 2 as (x3, y3) and (x4, y4),
    * as shown in Figure 3.8a and b.
    The intersecting point of the two lines can be found by solving the following linear equations:
        (y1 -y2)x-(x1 -x2)y=(y1 -y2)x1 -(x1 -x2)y1 (y3 -y4)x-(x3 -x4)y=(y3 -y4)x3 -(x3 -x4)y3
    This linear equation can be solved using Cramerâ€™s rule (see Programming Exercise 3.3).
    * If the equation has no solutions, the two lines are parallel (see Figure 3.8c).
    * Write a program that prompts the user to enter four points and displays the intersecting point.
    *  Here are sample runs:
    *
    * Enter x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4: 2 2 5 -1.0 4.0 2.0 -1.0 -2.0
    *       The intersecting point is at (2.88889, 1.1111)*/
